description: "Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair is a fantasy novel by William\
  \ Morris, perhaps the first modern fantasy writer to unite an imaginary world with\
  \ the element of the supernatural, and thus the precursor of much of present-day\
  \ fantasy literature. It was first published in hardcover by Morris' Kelmscott Press\
  \ in 1895. Its importance in the history of fantasy literature was recognized by\
  \ its republication by the Newcastle Publishing Company as the twelfth volume of\
  \ the celebrated Newcastle Forgotten Fantasy Library in April, 1977.\n\n\n From\
  \ Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
